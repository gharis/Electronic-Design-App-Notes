# Designing custom flyback based on ti design tools 

*Perform ti simulation web bench 

*Select a suitable IC 

*Use TI selected ic’s design tool .xlx file 

*Re calculate circuit spec 

*Find a suitable transformer supplier – inductance/i peak/ input and output voltage/ frequency  

*If standard/premade transformers are not available, transformer has to custom made (TDK, Wuerth Elektronik)
